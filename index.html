				Manchester is a major city in the northwest of England with a rich industrial heritage. The 18th-century canal system of the Castlefield Conservation Area harks back to the days when the city was a textile powerhouse, and you can trace this history at the interactive Museum of Science and Industry. The revitalised Salford Quays dockyards now houses the Daniel Libeskind-designed Imperial War Museum North and The Lowry cultural centre.
